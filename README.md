# BRACU CSE330: Numerical Methods Laboratory

A comprehensive repository containing lab implementations and solutions for the CSE330 Numerical Methods course at BRAC University. This collection showcases the numerical analysis techniques and algorithms learned throughout the course, implemented as part of the laboratory assignments.

## Course Overview

This repository contains practical implementations of fundamental numerical methods and algorithms covered in the CSE330 Numerical Methods course at BRAC University. The implementations focus on computational techniques for solving mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically, including interpolation, differentiation, integration, solving nonlinear equations, and numerical linear algebra.

## Faculty Information

### Lab Instructors:
- **Ayman Rasheed [ARD]** - 2022 ICPC World Finalist from Dhaka University
- **Atonu Roy Chowdhury [CARC]**

### Theory Instructor:
- **Saadat Rahin** - Former Data Scientist at Robi

## Topics Covered

This repository contains implementations of various numerical methods, including but not limited to[3]:

### Interpolation Methods
