# BRACU CSE330: Numerical Methods Laboratory

A comprehensive repository containing lab implementations and solutions for the CSE330 Numerical Methods course at BRAC University. This collection showcases the numerical analysis techniques and algorithms learned throughout the course, implemented as part of the laboratory assignments.

## Course Overview

This repository contains practical implementation of fundamental numerical methods and algorithms covered in the CSE330 Numerical Methods course at BRAC University. The implementations focus on computational techniques for solving mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically, including interpolation, differentiation, integration, solving nonlinear equations, and numerical linear algebra.

## Faculty Information
To visualize the instructors' profiles on GitHub README, I'll create a professional and visually appealing presentation using badges, icons, and proper formatting. Here's how you can implement this:
